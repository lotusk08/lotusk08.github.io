I’m Steve, as you've know. I am a man who enjoys understanding the world, building things to improve it, and discussing these topics on the internet. I love to keep things simple and focus on what I enjoy.

![About me](/assets/img/site/about-me.webp){: lqip="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRkwAAABXRUJQVlA4IEAAAAAQAgCdASoQAAsABUB8JbACdADxHF8KaoEAAP7AKlWu0Qig73p1rucOy/e2ScksvXY5Dc0zVVk/+ydl9gPPgAAA"} _Just me, being me_

I love reading; I can pick up a book or an article—whatever catches my eye. There’s no big plan, just reading what feels right and seeing where it takes me.

I’m also crazy about biking! I ride my Surly ECR with friends on long, pretty routes.

Life is beautiful, even when the skies aren’t blue. But, why not paint our vibrant colors across the canvas of our lives? Right?

Ah, I love capturing photographs on my journeys; preserving those moments makes the ordinary remarkable.

## This Site

I’ve been jotting down my thoughts online since 2009. In 2019, I started [skyquietly.com](https://skyquietly.com) on WordPress. Lately, I switched to Jekyll because it’s simple and easy to type it with Obsidian or another markdown editor. It lets me tweak things just how I like.

![Old website](/assets/img/site/old-website.webp){: lqip="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRpAAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAADwAACQAAQUxQSDAAAAARL6CgbRQ4Z+NecIEXIiJu4H2oaiCC2mQQwHQQ4NXA9C9zfwpE9H8CclD3MP6YowBWUDggOgAAANABAJ0BKhAACgAFQHwliALDsQhm4Q3AAP5J+FlFjocAfds3f/SGN3dekkIUQwN5fbP3pCrWCg+4sAA=" w='680'} _My old WordPress site—good times!_

This blog is my quiet corner where I share thoughts, ideas, and projects that matter to me.
I created it myself, using Jekyll, hosted on GitHub, and public through Cloudflare, but I don't plan to share this at the moment.
