## Hey there, I'm Steve

_I'm Steve_

As a marketer, I'm passionate about how businesses function, especially when it comes to enhancing the customer experience and delivering real value based on their needs. I strongly believe we can drive profits while staying true to ethical principles in business.

_I am who I am. Not whom you think I am!_

However, I spend a lot of time reading someone. Today is books, but tomorrow, there will be magazines to expand my knowledge. I don’t care about that kind of thing. I have read everything I wanted to, with no limit on type or scope.

In my spare time, I enjoy riding my Surly ECR bike with my friends and taking photos.

## This site
I've been blogging since 2019 on my old domain [skyquietly.com](https://skyquietly.com). I began with WordPress but switched to Jekyll, a static site generator, in 2022.

_My old website with WordPress_

This blog is my online hub where I jot down notes, share insights, promote best practices, write about topics I'm passionate about, sometimes vent about things, and showcase my creative projects.

I've personally redesigned and built for myself. Pages are generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/lotusk08/lotusk08.github.io) deployed on [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com), with media stored separately on CloudFront.
