To be honest, I’m not a programmer. I don’t know how to write code but enjoy tinkering and learning. I bought Nova when Panic introduced it, as I was already familiar with Coda and Coda 2. I used it to edit my blog and try out a few open-source projects shared by others on GitHub. That’s about it.

![Nova workspace](/assets/img/post/nova-workspace.webp "Nova workspace"){: lqip="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoQAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAADwAACAAAQUxQSDAAAAARL6AQkhU6qPAIvsWQSRERV3AfqhqIoDYZBDAdBHg1MP3L3JcEEf2fgBzUPYx/5ihWUDggLgAAANABAJ0BKhAACQAFQHwlnAAC51GNeL4AAP6bdttVsXDa1LEyBBke92LoR0oAAAA=" w='680'}

Panic introduced Coda, and later came the annual software upgrade/maintenance subscription. From my perspective as someone in marketing, I saw it as no different from those annoying subscription services out there. I understand that everyone needs revenue to survive. After all, people work to make money. I still paid for the subscription to use Nova.

From 2022 until now, for over a year, Nova has received small patch updates and minor tweaks. Paying $49 a year just for bug fixes didn’t sit well with me.

Then, strangely enough, when my subscription expired, Nova released a new update. It fixed more bugs, optimized things more, etc. I decided not to renew my subscription and switched to Zed. I don’t know how to write code, and before LLMs, I had to Google and read everything to modify my website the way I wanted. The whole process took a few days. Now, it’s much quicker—just a few minutes. Zed has features that Nova doesn’t, and vice versa... So now I find myself with one foot in each boat, which is uncomfortable, but still better than before.

![Nova update 12.2](/assets/img/post/nova-update.webp "Nova update 12.2"){: lqip="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRpYAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAADwAACQAAQUxQSC8AAAARL0CkbRvNhIyfX8DhIyLofKAqsg3KKwANdFBACf3LnC8JIvo/AVmoexj/etCEBQBWUDggQAAAANABAJ0BKhAACgAFQHwljAAC52XbLr2AAP3D1sJXgB5qjzdqms7eXePuMXVKIGRXu+OPOE0SdozMBsy2Ou78AAA=" w='520'}

On a beautiful day, Nova announced the 12.2 update, and to my surprise, it allowed me to update, even though my account had expired and I hadn’t renewed my subscription.

That day, I still made myself a cup of coffee, as usual, but the coffee tasted better.

I’m not here to evaluate or judge anything. I want to say that sometimes, being kind to existing customers is more important than chasing after new ones.

That’s my experience working in marketing.
