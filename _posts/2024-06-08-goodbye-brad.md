As we bid farewell to Brad Kelly, the outgoing General Director of Mercedes-Benz Vietnam (MBV). Mr. Kelly’s tenure, marked by record sales in 2022, will conclude at the end of June, paving the way for Mr. Bitterlich, currently the General Director of Mercedes-Benz Egypt, to take the helm.

On a suggestion from Mr. John - CEO of Vietnam Star Automobile, I have created a video clip to commemorate Mr. Kelly’s contributions during his farewell gathering. As a member of Vietnam Star, a partner company of MBV, it’s been an honor to collaborate and witness the growth and achievements under Mr. Kelly’s leadership. His legacy will undoubtedly inspire us as we embrace the future with Mr. Bitterlich at the steering wheel.
