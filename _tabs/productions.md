Since 2018, the e-commerce boom in Vietnam, led by Lazada, Shopee, and Tiki, has been educating the market with substantial investments. Despite the unconventional idea of selling motorbikes online, we took the plunge. Within two weeks, we made our first sale. During the peak 11.11 promotion, we achieved a remarkable revenue of 2 billion VND in a single day. Hoang Viet got 1 trillion VND in revenue that year.

## Video - memorable markers

The most memorable markers are the moments I captured in the following video.

## Thai Khuong Song

This melody embodies the soul of Thai Khuong, a place I considered my second home when composing this song. I hope it ignites within you the power of passion as you listen to its tune.

## Website

### Based on the customer journey
In my career, I've crafted numerous websites tailored to diverse audiences, including companies, community groups, and personal ventures. Beyond captivating UI design, a website's success hinges on content relevance and strategic optimization.
Through meticulous investment of time, creativity, and resources, we've curated an exemplary website experience.

### Content first
A business's mission is not only to make money but also to resolve the customers' problems. Understanding what customers face is a part of it. By expanding customers' knowledge, we can help them know what they don't know. We have a lot of high-end services as a product of business in the world; it's so hard to understand. That's why we need the marketing department to do some things like educational activities to get the best fit for themself.

So, through the 4w 1h methods, we can adapt what customers read/see/hear/feel and make a new generation.
