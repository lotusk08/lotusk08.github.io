Over time, I grew frustrated with tools that complicated rather than clarified my thoughts. I used MindNode before, but the subscription fees just to link the logic node of thinking left me wanting something more straightforward. 
[Obsidian](/obsidian) is not bad, but while I wait to open the app, my ideas will come air! I needed a simple way to capture and organize the things not organization, which must be simple, easy, and light.

I found [Markmap](https://markmap.js.org), it's a solution that truly resonated with me. I turned that style into the web app: [think.stevehoang.com](https://think.stevehoang.com). This tool helps map out thoughts clearly. It's open, feel free to try, use or sharing!
