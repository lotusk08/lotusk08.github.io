I'm Steve.

I understand the world by building things that improve it. I write to share what matters. Simple beats complex every time.

![About me](/assets/img/site/about-me.webp){: lqip="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRkwAAABXRUJQVlA4IEAAAAAQAgCdASoQAAsABUB8JbACdADxHF8KaoEAAP7AKlWu0Qig73p1rucOy/e2ScksvXY5Dc0zVVk/+ydl9gPPgAAA"} _Just me, being me_

I pick up books that call to me—philosophy, fiction, technical manuals. No grand reading lists, just curiosity following its own path. Every page teaches something, even if it's just how to think differently.

![Reading book](/assets/img/site/reading-book.webp){: lqip="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlgAAABXRUJQVlA4IEwAAACQAQCdASoQAAwABUB8JaQAAXhUeAAA/Nan+9Q8ejpBl6+ClK4x9G0ftCCMbStXFse0y8UdYzakqKfNBUFmDHND4hiR5e9NcEjkYAAA"} _Reading shapes me_

I've covered ground on two wheels since I could balance. Long routes with friends reveal more than destinations ever could.

Behind the lens, I hunt for moments that matter. Not the obvious shots—the quiet ones. The light between buildings. The expression that lasts half a second. Photography taught me to see before looking.

Since 2009, I've been putting thoughts online. Started with WordPress in 2019 at [skyquietly.com](https://skyquietly.com), then moved to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for control. Built this site myself*—a fork of [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) by [Cote](https://cotes.page)*. Edit in [Nova](https://nova.app), write in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), deploy with [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com).

## A note on privacy

I work in marketing, yet I resist being monitored. Real connection happens between people, not data points.

You found this page through something I wrote, someone's recommendation, or simple curiosity. That's enough context for me. I suspect you value the same authentic exchange.

I don't collect your information. No tracking, no analytics, no digital shadows. Read freely, comment if moved to, reach out when it feels right.

If something here resonates enough to share, please keep my name attached. That's all I ask.
