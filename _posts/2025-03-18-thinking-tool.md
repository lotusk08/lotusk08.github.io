Over time, I grew frustrated with tools that complicated rather than clarified my thoughts. I used MindNode before, but the subscription fees just to link the logic node of thinking left me wanting something more straightforward.

[Obsidian](/obsidian) is not bad, but while I wait to open the app, my ideas will come air! I needed a simple way to capture and organize the things not organization, which must be simple, easy, and light.

## Journey

My story begins with Obsidian.

### MindNode

I work in communications, so organizing and developing ideas is mandatory. I used MindNode to map out problems and connect thoughts. MindNode has a subscription fee that's not exactly cheap, but it's awesome and looks great.

### Obsidian

In 2023, I started using Obsidian. Thanks to Obsidian, I learned how to use Markdown. I also installed the Mindmap plugin. But using Obsidian for mindmapping isn't very practical. Obsidian doesn't load quickly, and the mindmap plugin isn't great (the developer made it for fun and then abandoned it for 3 years without updates).

### Cost

Recently, with the economy being tough, I cut all expenses that seemed unnecessary. All subscription services had to go (except for electricity, water, mobile, internet, and cloud).

But I can't work without tools. I didn't want to use "pirated" stuff (I used to be an admin for Maclife and the Vietnamese Macbook Association, so I know the price you pay for using sketchy software).

### Markmap

So I dug into that abandoned Mindmap plugin project on Obsidian from that developer who hadn't touched it in 3 years. That's how I discovered Markmap (a JavaScript library for creating mindmaps with markdown).

I continued researching to see if anyone had packaged Markmap as a standalone app for different operating systems. After searching for a while, I found a web-based project by a French guy named Eyssette.

I forked it immediately. I customized it to my liking, built it, and deployed it on the cloud for my use.

## Lesson

> Learning and practicing to do something might take time, but the experiences and sense of accomplishment are really special.
> I hope everyone gets to experience something like this too.
