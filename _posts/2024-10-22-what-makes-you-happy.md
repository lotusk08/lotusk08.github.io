## The Question:

> What makes you happy?
{: .prompt-warning }

I paused for a moment when I saw this question. It’s strange—I can't even remember what used to matter most to me.

## People

As I searched online, I stumbled upon a few perspectives that resonated:
- Happiness for some is receiving something: a gift, time, a helping hand, or even just an answer.
- Some feel alive regardless of milestones—wealth, glory, or achievements.
- Others find joy in owning or experiencing things, even if only temporarily.

They live their lives, some things feel right, others not so much. It’s simply who they are.

## The Truth

In reality, we often hold onto perceptions that might be a bit off-center:

> - Many of us don’t actually enjoy the hard work of personal growth; we’re just drawn to the rewards it brings.
- Success isn’t always what we’re after—we’re often just looking for the praise it brings.
- Money itself may not be what we seek; it’s the comfort and experiences money provides.
- Learning and knowledge? We tend to value these more for their utility than for the joy of learning itself.
- Love for our partners may often hinge on the benefits they bring to our lives.
- Families may not always be cherished for who they are but rather for the sense of security they provide.
- Nature captivates us, but often it’s the pleasure it offers that we’re drawn to.
- And life itself—sometimes, it’s only the pleasant moments we truly love.

It’s easy to convince ourselves that we’re passionate about something when, in fact, we might just desire its rewards. Does happiness lie here? Maybe... but it feels a little incomplete.

## Me

Each day, I wake up, work, come home… then do it all over again, day by day, grinding through routines—almost like an open-world game with no real plot!

One day, I noticed something:

I forget things easily, yet saying goodbye to people or places I love is always difficult. I share my life with [Too](/my-pet/) and my girlfriend. I can hurt, but they don’t.

## You?

So… how about you? What makes you happy?
