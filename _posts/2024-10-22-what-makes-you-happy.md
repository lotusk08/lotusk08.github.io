## The question:

>What makes you happy?
{: .prompt-warning }

My mind froze for a few seconds when I saw this question. I don't remember what was important to me a long time ago.

## People

While searching the internet, I found some answers like these:
- Receiving something from someone: a gift, time, help, or maybe even just an answer.
- Some people feel alive regardless of how many milestones they reach: wealth, glory, or achievements.
- Others feel happy owning something, doing something, even if it's only temporary or limited.

They live their lives. Some things are right, some things aren't. It's just who they are.

## Me

I wake up every day, go to work, do my job, come home... another day arrives, and I do it all over again to earn money... grinding day by day, like a boring open-world video game!

One day...

I realized that I easily forget what happens to me, but it's hard to say goodbye to anyone or anything I love.
I live with [Too](/my-pet/) and my girlfriend.
I can hurt, but they don't.

>The most important things in my life are those around me, not the things I own.

## You?

So... how about you? What makes you happy?
